abstract = {Component-based software engineering is aimed at managing the complexity of large-scale software development by composing systems from reusable parts. In order to understand or validate the behavior of a given system, one needs to acquire understanding of the components involved in combination with understanding how these components are instantiated, initialized and interconnected in the particular system. In practice, this task is often hindered by the heterogeneous nature of source and configuration artifacts and there is little to no tool support to help software engineers with such a system-wide analysis. This paper contributes a method to track and visualize information flow in a component-based system at various levels of abstraction. We propose a hierarchy of 5 interconnected views to support the comprehension needs of both safety domain experts and developers from our industrial partner. We discuss the implementation of our approach in a prototype tool, and present an initial qualitative evaluation of the effectiveness and usability of the proposed views for software development and software certification. The prototype was already found to be very useful and a number of directions for further improvement were suggested. We conclude by discussing these improvements and lessons learned.},

abstract = {Data flow analysis is a process for collecting run-time information about data in programs without actually executing them. In this paper, we focus at the use of data flow analysis to support program understanding and reverse engineering. Data flow analysis is beneficial for these applications since the information obtained can be used to compute relationships between data objects in programs. These relations play a key role, for example, in the determination of the logical components of a system and their interaction. The general support of program understanding and reverse engineering requires the ability to analyse a variety of source languages and the ability to combine the results of analysing multiple languages. We present a flexible and generic software architecture for describing and performing language-independent data flow analysis which allows such transparent multi-language analysis. All components of this architecture were formally specified.},

We classify these blocks in crosscutting concern sorts, and we use them to describe the crosscutting structure of many (well-known) designs and common mechanisms in software systems. In this paper, we formalize the notion of crosscutting concern sorts by means of relational queries over (object-oriented) source models. Based on these queries, we present a concern management tool called SOQUET, which can be used to document the occurrences of crosscutting concerns in object-oriented systems. We assess the sorts-based approach by using the tool to cover various crosscutting concerns in two open-source systems: JHOTDRAW and Java PETSTORE.},

abstract = {Many important phenomena within software engineering are difficult to define and measure. A good example is software maintainability, which has been the subject of considerable research and is believed to be a critical determinant of total software costs. Yet, there is no common agreement on how to describe and measure software maintainability in a concrete setting. We propose using concept mapping, a well-grounded method used in social research, to operationalize this concept according to a given goal and perspective. We apply this method to describe four systems that were developed as part of an industrial multiple-case study. The outcome is a conceptual map that displays an arrangement of maintainability constructs, their interrelations and corresponding measures. Our experience is that concept mapping (1) provides a structured way of combining static code analysis and expert judgment; (2) helps tailoring the choice of measures to a particular system context; and (3) supports the mapping between software measures and aspects of software maintainability. As such, it represents a strong addition to existing frameworks for evaluating quality such as ISO/IEC 9126 and GQM, and tools for static measurement of software code. Overall, we find that concept mapping provides a systematic, structured and repeatable method for developing constructs and measures of the phenomenon of interest, and we deem it useful for defining constructs and measures of other aspects of software engineering, in addition to maintainability.},

abstract = {Code smells are indicators of deeper problems in the design that may cause difficulties in the evolution of a system. While previous studies have mainly focused on studying the effects of individual smells on maintainability, we believe that interactions tend to occur between code smells. The research in this paper investigates the potential interactions amongst twelve different code smells, and how those interactions can lead to maintenance problems. Four medium-sized systems with equivalent functionality but dissimilar design were examined for smells. The systems were the object of several change requests for a period of four weeks. During that period, we recorded on a daily basis problems faced by developers and their associated Java files. The first analysis is based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to identify components formed by collocated code smells (i.e., smells located in the same file). Analysis on the nature of the problems, as reported by the developers in daily interviews and think-aloud sessions, revealed how some of the collocated smells interacted with each other, causing maintenance problems. Finally, we could observe that some interactions occur across files, for which we suggest integrating dependency analysis when analyzing effects of code smells on maintainability.},

Automatic type inference can help to understand the large collections of variable declarations contained therein, showing how variables are related based on their actual usage. The most problematic aspect of type inference is pollution, the phenomenon that types become too large, and contain variables that intuitively should not belong to the same type. The aim of the paper is to provide empirical evidence for the hypothesis that the use of subtyping is an effective way for dealing with pollution. The main results include a tool set to carry out type inference experiments, a suite of metrics characterizing type inference outcomes, and the experimental observation that only one instance of pollution occurs in the case study conducted.},

Large-scale product families face rapidly increasing maintenance challenges as their evolution can happen both as a result of collective domain engineering activities, and as a result of product-specific developments. To make informed decisions about prospective modifications, developers need to estimate what other sections of the system will be affected and need attention, which is known as change impact analysis. This paper contributes a method to carry out change impact analysis in a component-based product family, based on system-wide information flow analysis. We use static program slicing as the underlying analysis technique, and use model-driven engineering (MDE) techniques to propagate the ripple effects from a source code modification into all members of the product family. In addition, our approach ranks results based on an approximation of the scale of their impact. We have implemented our approach in a prototype tool, called Richter, which was evaluated on a real-world product family.},

abstract = {Many large-scale software-intensive systems are produced as instances of component-based product families, a well-known tactic to develop a portfolio of software products based on a collection of shared assets. However, sharing components between software products introduces dependencies that complicate maintenance and evolution: changes made in a component to address an issue in one product may have undesirable effects on other products in which the same component is used. Therefore, developers not only need to understand how a proposed change will impact the component and product at hand; they also need to understand how it affects the whole product family, including systems that are already deployed. Given that these systems contain thousands of components, it is no surprise that it is hard to reason about the impact of a change on a single product, let alone assess the effects of more complex evolution scenarios on a complete product family. Conventional impact analysis techniques do not suffice for large-scale software-intensive systems and highly populated product families, and software engineers need better support to conduct these tasks. Finally, for an accountable comparison of alternative evolution scenarios, a measure is needed to quantify the scale of impact for each strategy. This is especially important in our context of safety-critical systems since these need to undergo (costly) re-certification after a change. Cost-effective recommendations should prioritize evolution scenarios that minimize impact scale, and thereby minimize re-certification efforts. This paper explores how reverse engineering and program comprehension techniques can be used to develop novel recommendation technology that uses concrete evidence gathered from software artifacts to support engineers with the evolution of families of complex, safety-critical, software-intensive systems. We give an overview of the state of the art in this area, discuss some of the research directions that have been considered up to now and, identify challenges, and pose a number of research questions to advance the state of the art. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Code smells are indicators of issues with source code quality that may hinder evolution. While previous studies mainly focused on the effects of individual code smells on maintainability, we conjecture that not only the individual code smells but also the interactions between code smells affect maintenance. We empirically investigate the interactions amongst 12 code smells and analyze how those interactions relate to maintenance problems. Professional developers were hired for a period of four weeks to implement change requests on four medium-sized Java systems with known smells. On a daily basis, we recorded what specific problems they faced and which source files were associated with them. The collected data was analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify patterns of collocated code smells. Analysis of the nature of the problems observed revealed how certain smells that were collocated in the same file interacted with each other, causing maintenance problems. Moreover, we found that code smell interactions occurred across coupled files, with comparable negative effects as same-file collocation. We argue that future studies into the effects of code smells on maintainability should integrate dependency analysis in their process so that they can obtain a more complete understanding by including these coupled interactions.

abstract = {Program comprehension is an important activity in software maintenance, as software must be sufficiently understood before it can be properly modified. The study of a program's execution, known as dynamic analysis, has become a common technique in this respect and has received substantial attention from the research community, particularly over the last decade. These efforts have resulted in a large research body of which currently there exists no comprehensive overview. This paper reports on a systematic literature survey aimed at the identification and structuring of research on program comprehension through dynamic analysis. From a research body consisting of 4,795 articles published in 14 relevant venues between July 1999 and June 2008 and the references therein, we have systematically selected 172 articles and characterized them in terms of four main facets: activity, target, method, and evaluation. The resulting overview offers insight in what constitutes the main contributions of the field, supports the task of identifying gaps and opportunities, and has motivated our discussion of several important research directions that merit additional consideration in the near future.},

Other notable findings include that the different artefact types used as safety evidence seem to co-evolve, the evolution of safety case should probably be better managed, and no commercial impact analysis tool has been reported as used for all artefact types.

abstract = {The research presented in this talk is part of an ongoing industrial collaboration with Kongsberg Maritime (KM), one of the largest suppliers of maritime systems worldwide. The division that we work with specialises in computerised systems for safety monitoring and automatic corrective actions on unacceptable hazardous situations. In particular, we study a family of complex safety-critical embedded software systems that connect software control components to physical sensors and mechanical actuators. The overall goal of the collaboration is to provide our partner with software analysis tooling that provides source based evidence to support cost-effective certification and evolution of their systems. A frequently advocated approach to manage the development of complex software systems is to compose them from reusable components, instead of starting from scratch. Components may be implemented in different programming languages and are tied together using configuration files, or glue code, defining instantiation, initialisation and interconnections. Although analysis of programs within closed code boundaries has been studied for some decades and is well-established, there is surprisingly little support for incorporating information regarding the composition and configuration of components in the static verification and validation of these systems. Moreover, sharing components between software products introduces dependencies that complicate maintenance and evolution: changes made in a component to address an issue in one product may have undesirable effects on other products in which the same component is used. Therefore, developers not only need to understand how a proposed change will impact the component and product at hand; they also need to understand how it affects the whole product family, including systems that are already deployed. Given that these systems contain thousands of components, it is no surprise that it is hard to reason about the impact on a single product, let alone on a complete product family. Conventional impact analysis techniques do not suffice for large-scale software-intensive systems and highly populated product families, and engineers need better support to conduct these tasks. In the talk, we will discuss the techniques we developed to support analysis *across* the components of a heterogeneous component-based system. First, we reverse engineer fine-grained homogeneous models for systems composed of heterogeneous artifacts. Next, we track the information flow in these models using slicing, and apply several transformations that enable us to visualise the information flow at various levels of abstraction, trading off between scope and detail and aimed to serve both safety domain experts as well as developers. These techniques are implemented in a prototype tool-set that has been successfully used to answer software certification questions of our industrial partner. In addition, we discuss our ongoing research to build recommendation technology that supports engineers with the evolution of families of safety-critical, software-intensive systems. This technology builds on extensions of the previously discussed techniques to systematically reverse engineer abstract representations of software products to complete software product families, new algorithms to conduct scalable and precise change impact analysis (CIA) on such representations, and recommendation technology that uses the CIA results and constraint programming to find an evolution strategy that minimises re-certification efforts. Finally, if time permits, we will discuss some challenges, research opportunities and initial results around testing of such systems in an industrial setting.},

On the other side, an agile process may affect growth of entropy. We report from a case study of a successful software product line organization that has adopted the agile development method Evo, showing how agility and entropy are negatively related. We conclude this study by suggesting a two-step approach to manage entropy while maintaining process agility. First, the system needs to be restructured to establish a level of manageable entropy, and then, that the agile process must be complemented with continuous semi-automated quality monitoring and refactoring support.},

One of the major challenges of this phase is creating extractors that can deal with irregularities in the artifacts that are typical for the reverse engineering domain (for example, syntactic errors, incomplete source code, language dialects and embedded languages). The paper proposes a solution in the form of island grammars, a special kind of grammar that combines the detailed specification possibilities of grammars with the liberal behavior of lexical approaches. We show how island grammars can be used to generate robust parsers that combine the accuracy of syntactical analysis with the speed, flexibility and tolerance usually only found in lexical analysis.

abstract = {Past research has proposed association rule mining as a means to uncover the evolutionary coupling from a system's change history. These couplings have various applications, such as improving system decomposition and recommending related changes during development. The strength of the coupling can be characterized using a variety of interestingness measures. Existing recommendation engines typically use only the rule with the highest interestingness value in situations where more than one rule applies. In contrast, we argue that multiple applicable rules indicate increased evidence, and hypothesize that the aggregation of such rules can be exploited to provide more accurate recommendations. To investigate this hypothesis we conduct an empirical study on the change histories of two large industrial systems and four large open source systems. As aggregators we adopt three cumulative gain functions from information retrieval. The experiments evaluate the three using 39 different rule interestingness measures. The results show that aggregation provides a significant impact on most measure's value and, furthermore, leads to a significant improvement in the resulting recommendation.},

Not only can enforcing compliance with rules that have little impact on the number of faults be considered a wasted effort, it can actually result in an increase in faults, as any modification has a non-zero probability of introducing a fault or triggering a previously concealed one. Therefore, it is important to build a body of empirical knowledge that helps us understand which rules are worthwhile enforcing, and which ones can be ignored in the context of fault reduction. In this talk, we reflect on our efforts to quantify and characterize the relation between rule violations and actual faults for the MISRA C 2004 standard on three industrial case studies. We found that 10 rules in the standard were significant predictors of fault location in these projects. We discuss how software and issue archives can be used to link standard violations to known bugs, and how this information can be used to address two practical issues in introducing or using a coding standard: which rules should be adhered to as they would have caught earlier issues, and how to prioritize violations. Our studies showed that such a history-based approach can help to select a subset of rules that reduce the number of locations to inspect by 64{\%} to 95{\%}, while still containing 64{\%} to 86{\%} of the real issues covered by all rules.},

@article{yazdanshenas:2015:cross-language,
abstract = {Contemporary software systems are rarely implemented uniformly in one programming language, and delivered in one type of development artifact. Instead, it is common practice to use the programming language that fits best to develop each part of the system. Moreover, in large-scale legacy software systems, the maintainance process often has to deal with several programming languages and artifacts simultaneously. This heterogeneity complicates most system-wide tasks in the evolution of such multi-language systems, as cross-language dependencies and interactions are substantially more difficult to identify and manage. This paper seeks to provide a basis for the improvement of software evolution of multi-language systems, by assessing the state of the art in cross-language program analysis, and discussing the implications for research and practice. We conduct a systematic review over the available literature in seven digital libraries, to find the relevant primary studies on cross-language program analysis, and identify additional studies with manual snowballing. We classify the studies based on several criteria, including their purpose (why), the adopted or suggested approach (how), the information leveraged in each programming language or artifact (what), and the conducted evaluation (quality). Our investigation identified 75 relevant papers, which were analysed in depth to answer eight research questions. The results include objective findings on the diversity of the applied techniques, application domains, programming languages, and reliability of the approaches. Building on these findings, several implications for research and practice are discussed, including potential breakthroughs based on use of historic data, and possible negative effects of having a shortage of community-driven research.},

abstract = {Understanding a software system at source-code level requires understanding the different concerns that it addresses, which in turn requires a way to identify these concerns in the source code. Whereas some concerns are explicitly represented by program entities (like classes, methods and variables) and thus are easy to identify, crosscutting concerns are not captured by a single program entity but are scattered over many program entities and are tangled with the other concerns. Because of their crosscutting nature, such crosscutting concerns are difficult to identify, and reduce the understandability of the system as a whole. In this paper, we report on a combined experiment in which we try to identify crosscutting concerns in the JHotDraw framework automatically. We first apply three independently developed aspect mining techniques to JHotDraw and evaluate and compare their results. Based on this analysis, we present three interesting combinations of these three techniques, and show how these combinations provide a more complete coverage of the detected concerns as compared to the original techniques individually. Our results are a first step towards improving the understandability of a system that contains crosscutting concerns, and can be used as a basis for refactoring the identified crosscutting concerns into aspects.},

The proposed strategy consists of four steps: mining, exploration, documentation and refactoring of crosscutting concerns. We discuss in detail a new approach to refactoring to aspect-oriented programming that is fully integrated with our strategy, and apply the whole strategy to an object-oriented system, namely the JHotDraw framework. Moreover, we present a method to semi-automatically perform the aspect-introducing refactorings based on identified crosscutting concern sorts which is supported by a prototype tool called SAIR. We perform an exploratory case study in which we apply this tool on the same object-oriented system and compare its results with the results of manual migration in order to assess the feasibility of automated aspect refactoring. Both the refactoring tool SAIR and the results of the manual migration are made available as open-source, the latter providing the largest aspect-introducing refactoring available to date. We report on our experiences with conducting both case studies and reflect on the success and challenges of the migration process.},

As such, code smells could be ideal indicators to monitor the ``health'' of a system throughout its evolution, and to guide refactoring efforts to sustain comprehensibility and maintainability. Much code smell related work by both researchers and tool vendors has focused on the formalization and detection of code smells. Recently, studies have started to deeper investigate the impact of smells on software maintenance and evolution. However, there is a long road to go before code smell analysis can cost-efficiently drive exactly those refactorings that will improve the comprehensibility and maintainability of a given system. We identify four challenges to be tackled before we can reach this goal: (1) Lack of a common vocabulary to build a consistent knowledge base, (2) Lack of an ontological framework to compare/synthesize results across studies, (3) Lack of an evaluation framework to compare/evaluate the quality of detection approaches, and (4) Lack of a research agenda to make the knowledge/tools accessible to industrial contexts. The ARCS workshop will bring the members of this community together to establish a common research agenda addressing each of these challenges.},

This information overload effectively limits their usefulness. In this paper we present ELAN, a technique that helps the user prioritize the information generated by a software inspection tool, based on a demand-driven computation of the likelihood that execution reaches the locations for which warnings are reported. This analysis is orthogonal to other prioritization techniques known from literature, such as severity levels and statistical analysis to reduce false positives.

While the use of dynamic analysis in this process has become increasingly popular, the literature indicates that dealing with the huge amounts of dynamic information remains a formidable challenge. Although various trace reduction techniques have been proposed to address these scalability concerns, their applicability in different contexts often remains unclear because extensive comparisons are lacking. This makes it difficult for end-users to determine which reduction types are best suited for a certain analysis task. In this paper, we propose an assessment methodology for the evaluation and comparison of trace reduction techniques. We illustrate the methodology using a selection of four types of reduction methods found in literature, which we evaluate and compare using a test set of seven large execution traces. Our approach enables a systematic assessment of trace reduction techniques, which eases the selection of suitable reductions in different settings, and allows for a more effective use of dynamic analysis tools in software maintenance.},

To some extend, this question applies as well to the results provided by current code smell detection tools. Are code smells really important for developers? If they are not, is this due to the lack of relevance of the underlying concepts, due to the lack of awareness about code smells on the developers' side, or due to the lack of appropriate tools for code smell analysis or removal? In order to align and direct research efforts to address actual needs and problems of professional developers, we need to better understand the knowledge about, and interest in code smells, together with their perceived criticality.

abstract = {Context: Code smells are indicators of poor coding and design choices that can cause problems during software maintenance and evolution. Objective: This study is aimed at a detailed investigation to which extent problems in maintenance projects can be predicted by the detection of currently known code smells. Method: A multiple case study was conducted, in which the problems faced by six developers working on four different Java systems were registered on a daily basis, for a period up to four weeks. Where applicable, the files associated to the problems were registered. Code smells were detected in the pre-maintenance version of the systems, using the tools Borland Together and InCode. In-depth examination of quantitative and qualitative data was conducted to determine if the observed problems could be explained by the detected smells. Results: From the total set of problems, roughly 30{\%} percent were related to files containing code smells. In addition, interaction effects were observed amongst code smells, and between code smells and other code characteristics, and these effects led to severe problems during maintenance. Code smell interactions were observed between collocated smells (i.e., in the same file), and between coupled smells (i.e., spread over multiple files that were coupled). Conclusions: The role of code smells on the overall system maintainability is relatively minor, thus complementary approaches are needed to achieve more comprehensive assessments of maintainability. Moreover, to improve the explanatory power of code smells, interaction effects amongst collocated smells and coupled smells should be taken into account during analysis.

Objective: This paper contributes a method to analyze and visualize information flow in a component-based system at various levels of abstraction. These visualizations are designed to support the comprehension needs of both safety domain experts and software developers for, respectively, certification and evolution of safety-critical cyber-physical systems. Method: We build system-wide dependence graphs and use static program slicing to determine all possible end-to-end information flows through and across a system's components. We define a hierarchy of five abstractions over these information flows that reduce visual distraction and cognitive overload, while satisfying the users' information needs. We improve on our earlier work to provide interconnected views that support both systematic, as well as opportunistic navigation scenarios. Results: We discuss the design and implementation of our approach and the resulting views in a prototype tool called FlowTracker. We summarize the results of a qualitative evaluation study, carried out via two rounds of interview, on the effectiveness and usability of these views. We discuss a number of improvements, such as more selective information presentations, that resulted from the evaluation. Conclusion: The evaluation shows that the proposed approach and views are useful for understanding and validating heterogeneous component-based systems, and address information needs that could earlier only be met by manual inspection of the source code. We discuss lessons learned and directions for future work.},

Not only can compliance with a set of rules having little impact on the number of faults be considered wasted effort, but it can actually result in an increase in faults, as any modification has a non-zero probability of introducing a fault or triggering a previously concealed one. Therefore, it is important to build a body of empirical knowledge, helping us understand which rules are worthwhile enforcing, and which ones should be ignored in the context of fault reduction. In this paper, we describe two approaches to quantify the relation between rule violations and actual faults, and present empirical data on this relation for the MISRA C 2004 standard on an industrial case study.},

abstract = {Case studies are a research method aimed at holistically analyzing a phenomenon in its context. Despite the fact that they cannot be used to answer the same precise research questions as, e.g., can be addressed by controlled experiments, case studies can cope much better with situations having several variables of interest, multiple sources of evidence, or rich contexts that cannot be controlled or isolated. As such, case studies are a promising instrument to study the complex phenomena at play in Software Engineering. However, the use of case studies as research methodology entails certain challenges. We argue that one of the biggest challenges is the case selection bias when conducting multiple-case studies. In practice, cases are frequently selected based on their availability, without appropriate control over moderator factors. This hinders the level of comparability across cases, leading to internal validity issues. In this paper, we discuss the notion of assembling cases as a plausible alternative to selecting cases to overcome the selection bias problem when conducting multiple-case studies. In addition, we present and discuss our experiences from applying this approach in a study designed to investigate the impact of software design on maintainability.},

The work presents an approach for the automatic detection and visualization of code smells and discusses how this approach could be used in the design of a software inspection tool. The feasibility of the proposed approach was illustrated with the development of jCOSMO, a prototype code smell browser that detects and visualizes code smells in JAVA source code. It was the first tool to automatically detect code smells in source code, and we demonstrated the application of this tool in an industrial quality assessment case study. In addition to reviewing the WCRE 2002 work, we will discuss subsequent developments in this area by looking at a selection of papers that were published in its wake. In particular, we will have a look at recent related work in which we empirically investigated the relation between code smells and software maintainability in a longitudinal study where professional developers were observed while maintaining four different software systems that exhibited known code smells. We conclude with a discussion of the lessons learned and opportunities for further research. Index Terms: software inspection, quality assurance, Java, refactoring, code smells.},

The use of dynamic information to aid in this software understanding process is a common practice nowadays. A major issue in this context is scalability: due to the vast amounts of information, it is a very difficult task to successfully navigate through the dynamic data contained in execution traces without getting lost. In this paper, we propose the use of two novel trace visualization techniques based on the massive sequence and circular bundle view, which both reflect a strong emphasis on scalability. These techniques have been implemented in a tool called Extravis. By means of distinct usage scenarios that were conducted on three different software systems, we show how our approach is applicable in three typical program comprehension tasks: trace exploration, feature location, and top-down analysis with domain knowledge.},

abstract = {Association rule mining is an unsupervised learning technique that infers relationships among items in a data set. This technique has been successfully used to analyze a system's change history and uncover evolutionary coupling between system artifacts. Evolutionary coupling can, in turn, be used to recommend artifacts that are potentially impacted by a given set of changes to the system. In general, the quality of such recommendations is affected by (1) the values selected for various parameters of the mining algorithm, (2) the characteristics of the change set used to derive the recommendation, and (3) the characteristics of the system's change history for which recommendations are generated. In this paper, we empirically investigate the extent to which these factors affect change impact recommendations. Specifically, we conduct a series of systematic experiments on the change histories of two large industrial systems and eight large open source systems, in which we control the change size for which to derive recommendations, the measure used to assess the strength of the evolutionary coupling, and the maximum size of historical changes taken into account when inferring these couplings. We use the results from our study to derive a number of practical guidelines for applying association rule mining to derive software change impact recommendations.},

Moreover, sharing components between software products introduces dependencies that complicate maintenance and evolution: changes made in a component to address an issue in one product may have undesirable effects on other products in which the same component is used. Therefore, developers not only need to understand how a proposed change will impact the component and product at hand; they also need to understand how it affects the whole product family, including systems that are already deployed. Given that these systems contain thousands of components, it is no surprise that it is hard to reason about the impact on a single product, let alone on a complete product family. Conventional impact analysis techniques do not suffice for large-scale software-intensive systems and highly populated product families, and engineers need better support to conduct these tasks.

This paper proposes an aspect mining approach based on determining methods that are called from many different places, and hence have a high fan-in, which can be seen as a symptom of crosscutting functionality. The approach is semi-automatic, and consists of three steps: metric calculation, method filtering, and call site analysis. Carrying out these steps is an interactive process supported by an Eclipse plug-in called FINT. Fan-in analysis has been applied to three open source Java systems, totaling around 200,000 lines of code. The most interesting concerns identified are discussed in detail, which includes several concerns not previously discussed in the aspect-oriented literature. The results show that a significant number of crosscutting concerns can be recognized using fan-in analysis, and each of the three steps can be supported by tools.},
