Although I try to keep the overview here up to date, it depends on external scripting, which sometimes breaks. If that should happen, you can also find publication overviews on <a href="https://www.simula.no/people/leon">my Simula homepage</a> (with PDFs) or via <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vndz7hwAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a>, <a href="http://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/m/Moonen:Leon.html">DBLP</a>, or <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/profiles/leon-moonen/">Mendeley</a>.
