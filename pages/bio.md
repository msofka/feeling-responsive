Michal Sofka is currently leading the deep learning team at [Hyperfine Research][hyperfine] in New York. Hyperfine created an innovative point-of-care MRI, that wheels directly to the patientâ€™s bedside, plugs into a standard electrical wall outlet, and is controlled via a wireless tablet. Michal is on a mission to develop algorithms that improve images and run on the scanner and tools for image interpretation that run in the cloud. Hyperfine is a member of [4Catalyzer][4catalyzer], a group of technological startups focused on developing new types of sensors and pairing them with deep learning to get a new window into biology and medicine. Until 2017, Michal worked on automated measurements and scan acquisition assistance for the iQ, new hand-held ultrasound device developed by [Butterfly Network][butterfly], another 4Catalyzer company.
Before joining 4Catalyzer, Michal was a senior technical leader in the Cisco's [Cognitive Threat Analytics][CTA] team in Prague, Czech Republic. The group grew out of a university startup [acquired by Cisco][acquisition] in 2013. Michal lead the design and development of new machine learning algorithms for large scale traffic analysis for threat defense. Prior to Cisco, Michal worked as a senior scientist and project leader at [Siemens Corporate Research][scr], top healthcare industrial R&D lab in Princeton, New Jersey. Between 2008 and 2013, he managed and directly contributed to [image analytics][analytics] solutions for Siemens business units and external customers, including award-winning product for J&J.
Michal completed his undergraduate work at the Czech Technical University. He received the MS degree in Electrical Engineering from Union College and MS and PhD degrees in [Computer Science][rpics] from the [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)][rpi].
