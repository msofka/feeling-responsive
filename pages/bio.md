Leon Moonen is a senior research scientist in the Software Engineering department at Simula Research Laboratory, Norway. His research aims at creating better techniques and tools to support the understanding, assessment and evolution of large industrial software systems. This work involves the combination of several fields, such as software analytics, program comprehension, software reverse engineering, software repository mining, machine learning and empirical software engineering. Leon likes to work in close collaboration with industry to ensure that his research addresses questions of practical value, and to evaluate candidate solutions in real-life circumstances. Currently ongoing projects include recommendation systems to support smarter evolution and testing of safety-critical cyber-physical product families, high integrity software engineering, machine learning for anti-fragile software engineering, and software analytics for continuous software quality and maintainability assessments.

Dr. Moonen has published over 100 scientific papers (over 3345 citations, h-index: 29, i10-index: 53) and serves on steering-, organizing-, and program committees of international conferences on software maintenance (ICSM/ICSME), reverse engineering (WCRE), program understanding (ICPC), and source code analysis (SCAM) and he has (co-)organized various workshops on topics related to these areas. Before moving to Simula, he was assistant professor Software Engineering at Delft University of Technology where he taught courses on software evolution and software architecture. He has been advisor to 6 PhD students, 5 Post-docs and 17 MSc students. He is co-founder of the Software Improvement Group, a company that specializes in the use of source code analysis to help organizations get control over their software systems. Dr Moonen received his MSc (cum laude, Computer Science, 1996) and PhD (Computer Science, 2002) from the University of Amsterdam. He is a member of ACM, IEEE Computer Society, EAPLS and the ERCIM Working Group on Software Evolution.
