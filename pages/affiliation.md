I am currently a principal scientist at [4Catalyzer][4catalyzer] in New York working on various [research problems][research] to launch exciting products. 4Catalyzer is focused on developing new types of sensors and pairing them with deep learning to get a window into biology and medicine that nobody has ever had before. From the 4Catalyzer companies, I am mostly involved with [Butterfly Nework][butterfly] and [Hyperfine Research][hyperfine]. [Contact me][contact] if you are looking for an internship or permanent position in deep learning for medical image analysis. 

Before coming to New York, I was a senior technical leader in the Cisco's Cognitive Threat Analytics team in Prague, Czech Republic. The group grew out of an university startup [acquired by Cisco][acquisition] in 2013 and is a leader in designing new machine learning algorithms for malicious network traffic detection. Prior to Cisco, I worked as a senior scientist and project leader at [Siemens Corporate Research][scr] in Princeton, New Jersey. The top industrial R&D lab provides [image analytics][analytics] solutions for Siemens business units and external customers. I got my PhD at the [Department of Computer Science][rpics] at [RPI][rpi].
