I am currently a [senior research scientist][simhome] at [Simula Research Laboratory][simula] in Norway. [Contact me][contact] if you are interested in discussing opportunities to work with us on [addressing concrete software engineering needs][research] in industry and society based on fundamental research results.

Before moving to Norway, I was [assistant professor][tudhome] in the [Software Evolution Research Lab][swerl] at [Delft University of Technology][tud], the Netherlands, and researcher in (what is now) the [Software Analysis and Transformation][swat] group at the [Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI)][cwi] in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Collaborations in both these groups have helped to shape my research interests in exploring novel techniques that are directly aimed at addressing concrete, real-life software engineering challenges. 

I am one of the founders of the [Software Improvement Group (SIG)][sig], a company that helps organizations deal with software (legacy) issues by means of automatic source code analysis, software risk assessments, software monitoring and automatic (re)generation of technical documentation based on source code analysis. Starting with a small team of 6 people in 2000, SIG now employs 90 people in 2015 and is a key player in evidence-based software quality improvement.
