## No worries though...

You can start over fresh from our [home page]({{ site.url }}) or search the site:

{% include google_search %}

<form style="padding-bottom: 200px;" onsubmit="google_search()" >
  <input type="text" id="google-search" placeholder="{{ site.data.language.enter_search_term }}">
</form>
