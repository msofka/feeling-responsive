      <h1>Automatic Multi-Organ Segmentation Using Learning-based Segmentation and Level Set Optimization</h1><br>
      <p class=text><b><A NAME="overview">Abstract</A></b></p>
       <p class=text>We present a novel generic segmentation system for the fully automatic multi-organ segmentation from CT medical images. Thereby we combine the advantages of learning-based approaches on point cloud-based shape representation, such a speed, robustness, point correspondences, with those of PDE-optimization-based level set approaches, such as high accuracy and the straightforward prevention of segment overlaps. In a benchmark on 10-100 annotated datasets for the liver, the lungs, and the kidneys we show that the proposed system yields segmentation accuracies of 1.17-2.89mm average surface errors. Thereby the level set segmentation (which is initialized by the learning-based segmentations) contributes with an 20%-40% increase in accuracy. </p>
