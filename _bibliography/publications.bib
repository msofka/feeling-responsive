abstract = {Discretization of continuous input functions into piecewise constant or piecewise linear approximations is needed in many mathematical modeling problems. It has been shown that choosing the length of the piecewise segments adaptively based on data samples leads to improved accuracy of the subsequent processing such as classification. Traditional approaches are often tied to a particular classification model which results in local greedy optimization of a criterion function. This paper proposes a technique for learning the discretization parameters along with the parameters of a decision function in a convex optimization of the true objective. The general formulation is applicable to a wide range of learning problems. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed convex algorithms yield models with fewer number of parameters with comparable or better accuracy than the existing methods.},

This represents a challenge to the network security industry as the amount and variability of incidents has been increasing. Consequently, this complicates the design of learning-based detection systems relying on features extracted from network data. The problem is caused by different joint distribution of observation (features) and labels in the training and testing data sets. This paper proposes a classification system designed to detect both known as well as previously unseen security threats. The classifiers use statistical feature representation computed from the network traffic and learn to recognize malicious behavior. The representation is designed and optimized to be invariant to the most common changes of malware behaviors. This is achieved in part by a feature histogram constructed for each group of HTTP flows (proxy log records) of a user visiting a particular hostname and in part by a feature self-similarity matrix computed for each group. The parameters of the representation (histogram bins) are optimized and learned based on the training samples along with the classifiers. The proposed classification system was deployed on large corporate networks, where it detected 2,090 new and unseen variants of malware samples with 90\% precision (9 of 10 alerts were malicious), which is a considerable improvement when compared to the current flow-based approaches or existing signature-based web security devices.}

However, this assumption is violated in many real world problems, such as training a detector of malicious network traffic that can change over time as a result of attacker's detection evasion efforts. We propose to address this problem by creating an optimized representation, which significantly increases the robustness of detectors or classifiers trained under this distributional shift. The representation is created from bags of samples (e.g. network traffic logs) and is designed to be invariant under shifting and scaling of the feature values extracted from the logs and under permutation and size changes of the bags. The invariance is achieved by combining feature histograms with feature self-similarity matrices computed for each bag and significantly reduces the difference between the training and testing data. The parameters of the representation, such as histogram bin boundaries, are learned jointly with the classifier.

can be built given only a limited amount of information extracted from a single proxy log. This way, the computational requirements

The goal of the object localization is to accurately find the object pose parameters relative to an established reference, such as the origin of the image coordinate system. The object classification assigns class labels to the objects according to the pre-specified categories. Multi-object recognition has been previously solved by designing a set of individual single-object detectors or by training a combined multi-object detection and classification system. In the medical domain, these models can be further improved by relying on strong spatial prior information present in medical images of a human body. This chapter describes, how the spatial prior can be used to recognize multiple anatomical structures which results in the Integrated Detection Network. The structures are recognized sequentially, one-by-one, using optimal order such that the later recognitions can benefit from constraints provided by previously recognized structures. The recognition relies on Sequential Estimation techniques, with the posterior distribution of the structure pose and label being approximated at each step by sequential Monte Carlo. The samples are propagated within the sequence across multiple structures and hierarchical levels. The system is general and provides accurate recognitions of anatomical structures in 3D images of various modalities.}

	       for automatically measuring anatomical structures from 3D
	       ultrasound volumes. The system searches the 3D volume in a

	       likely to be the measured anatomy. The output is a standardized
	       visualization of the plane with correct orientation and
	       centering as well as the biometric measurement of the anatomy.
	       The system is based on a novel framework for detecting multiple
	       structures in 3D volumes. Since a joint model is difficult to
	       obtain in most practical situations, the structures are

  abstract =	 {In the clinical workflow for lung cancer management,
                  the comparison of nodules between CT scans from
                  subsequent visits by a patient is necessary for
                  timely classification of pulmonary nodules into
                  benign and malignant and for analyzing nodule growth
                  and response to therapy. The algorithm described in
                  this paper takes (a) two temporally-separated CT
                  scans, I1 and I2, and (b) a series of nodule
                  locations in I1, and for each location it produces
                  an affine transformation that maps the locations and
                  their immediate neighborhoods from I1 to I2. It does
                  this without deformable registration and without
                  initialization by global affine
                  registration. Requiring the nodule locations to be
                  specified in only one volume provides the clinician
                  more flexibility in investigating the condition of
                  the lung. The algorithm uses a combination of
                  feature extraction, indexing, refinement, and
                  decision processes. Together, these processes
                  essentially ``recognize'' the neighborhoods. We show
                  on lung CT scans that our technique works at near
                  interactive speed and that the median alignment
                  error of 134 nodules is 1.70 mm compared to the
                  error 2.14 mm of the Diffeomorphic Demons algorithm,
                  and to the error 3.57 mm of the global nodule
                  registration with local refinement. We demonstrate
                  on the alignment of 250 nodules, that the algorithm
                  is robust to changes caused by cancer progression
                  and differences in breathing states, scanning
                  procedures, and patient positioning. Our algorithm
                  may be used both for diagnosis and treatment
                  monitoring of lung cancer. Because of the generic
                  design of the algorithm, it might also be used in
                  other applications that require fast and accurate
                  mapping of regions.},

                  detecting multiple objects in 2D and 3D
                  images. Since a joint multi-object model is
                  difficult to obtain in most practical situations, we
                  focus here on detecting the objects sequentially,
                  one-by-one. The interdependence of object poses and
                  strong prior information embedded in our domain of
                  medical images results in better performance than
                  detecting the ob- jects individually. Our approach
                  is based on Sequential Estimation techniques,
                  frequently applied to visual tracking. Unlike in
                  tracking, where the sequential order is naturally
                  determined by the time sequence, the order of
                  detection of multiple objects must be selected,
                  leading to a Hierarchical Detection Network
                  (HDN). We present an algorithm that optimally
                  selects the order based on probability of states
                  (object poses) within the ground truth region. The
                  posterior distribution of the object pose is
                  approximated at each step by sequential Monte
                  Carlo. The samples are propagated within the
                  sequence across multiple objects and hierarchical
                  levels. We show on 2D ultrasound images of left
                  atrium, that the automatically selected sequential
                  order yields low mean detection error. We also
                  quantitatively evaluate the hierarchical detection
                  of fetal faces and three fetal brain structures in
                  3D ultrasound images.},

                  uncertainty in point correspondences. This
                  uncertainty is derived from the covariance matrices
                  of the individual point locations and from the
                  covariance matrix of the estimated transformation
                  parameters. Based on this uncertainty, CDC uses a

                  low-contrast and narrow vessels and eliminating
                  false detections at non-vascular structures, a new
                  technique is presented for extracting vessels in
                  retinal images. The core of the technique is a new
                  likelihood ratio test that combines matched-filter
                  responses, confidence measures and vessel boundary
                  measures. Matched filter responses are derived in
                  scale-space to extract vessels of widely varying
                  widths. A vessel confidence measure is defined as a
                  projection of a vector formed from a normalized
                  pixel neighborhood onto a normalized ideal vessel
                  profile. Vessel boundary measures and associated
                  confidences are computed at potential vessel
                  boundaries. Combined, these responses form a
                  6-dimensional measurement vector at each pixel. A
                  training technique is used to develop a mapping of
                  this vector to a likelihood ratio that measures the
                  ``vesselness'' at each pixel. Results comparing this
                  vesselness measure to matched filters alone and to
                  measures based on the Hessian of intensities show
                  substantial improvements both qualitatively and
                  quantitatively. The Hessian can be used in place of
                  the matched filter to obtain similar but
                  less-substantial improvements or to steer the
                  matched filter by preselecting kernel
                  orientations. Finally, the new vesselness likelihood
                  ratio is embedded into a vessel tracing framework,
                  resulting in an efficient and effective vessel

                  be aligned. The technique should handle image pairs

                  substantial scene changes, and different

                  algorithms for initialization, estimation and
                  refinement, and decision-making. It starts by
                  extracting and matching keypoints. Rank-ordered
                  matches are tested individually in succession. Each

                  differences, large illumination variations, and
                  physical changes in the scene. An important
                  component of this is the ability to automatically
                  reject pairs that have no overlap or have too many
                  differences to be aligned well. \\ We propose a

                  Dual-Bootstrap ICP algorithm, driven by matching of
                  multiscale features. A three-part decision criteria,
                  combining measurements of alignment accuracy,
                  stability in the estimate, and consistency in the

                  challenging image pairs show that the algorithm
                  effectively aligns 19 of the 22 pairs and rejects
                  99.8\% of the misalignments that occur when all
                  possible pairs are tried. The algorithm

    Background:
    In the concept of cloud-computing-based systems, various authorized users have secure access to patient records from a number of care delivery organizations from any location. This creates a growing need for remote visualization, advanced image processing, state-of-the-art image analysis, and computer aided diagnosis.
    Objectives:
    This paper proposes a system of algorithms for automatic detection of anatomical landmarks in 3D volumes in the cloud computing environment. The system addresses the inherent problem of limited bandwidth between a (thin) client, data center, and data analysis server.
    Methods:
    The problem of limited bandwidth is solved by a hierarchical sequential detection algorithm that obtains data by progressively transmitting only image regions required for processing. The client sends a request to detect a set of landmarks for region visualization or further analysis.
    The algorithm running on the data analysis server obtains a coarse level image from the data center and generates landmark location candidates. The candidates are then used to obtain image neighborhood regions at a finer resolution level for further detection.
    This way, the landmark locations are hierarchically and sequentially detected and refined.
    Results:
    Only image regions surrounding landmark location candidates need to be transmitted during detection. Furthermore, the image regions are \emph{lossy} compressed with JPEG 2000. Together, these properties amount to at least 30 times bandwidth reduction while achieving similar accuracy when compared to an algorithm using the original data.
    Conclusions:
    The hierarchical sequential algorithm with progressive data transmission considerably reduces bandwidth requirements in cloud-based detection systems.},

                  in CT are unable to deal with high density tissue common in pulmonary
                  diseases. To overcome this problem, we propose a multi-stage learning-
                  based approach that combines anatomical information to predict an ini-
                  tialization of a statistical shape model of the lungs. The initialization
                  first detects the carina of the trachea, and uses this to detect a set of
                  automatically selected stable landmarks on regions near the lung (e.g.,
                  ribs, spine). These landmarks are used to align the shape model, which is
                  then refined through boundary detection to obtain fine-grained segmen-
                  tation. Robustness is obtained through hierarchical use of discriminative
                  classifiers that are trained on a range of manually annotated data of dis-
                  eased and healthy lungs. We demonstrate fast detection (35s per volume
                  on average) and segmentation of 2 mm accuracy on challenging data.}

	  surgical planning. Many state-of-the-art approaches address
	  this problem by starting from the root and progressing towards
	  thinnest tubular structures usually guided by image filtering
	  techniques. These approaches need to be tailored for each
	  application and can fail in noisy or low-contrast regions. In
	  this work, we address these challenges by a two-layer model
	  which consists of a low-level likelihood measure and a
	  high-level measure verifying tubular branches. The algorithm
	  starts by computing robust measure of tubular presence using a
	  discriminative classifier at multiple image scales. The measure
	  is then used in an efficient multi-scale shortest path
	  algorithm to generate candidate centerline branches and
	  corresponding radii measurements. Finally, the branches are
	  verified by a learning-based indicator function that discards
	  false candidate branches. The experiments on detecting airways
	  in rotational X-ray volumes show that the technique is robust
	  to noise and correctly finds airways even in the presence of
	  imaging artifacts.}

				  and (2) liver boundary detection in MRI volumes. Modifying
				  the detection pipeline is simple and allows for immediate

					We present an editing approach that uses a user-drawn
