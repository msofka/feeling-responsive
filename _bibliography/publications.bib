                  is a fast growing field, which has so far shown promising results. However,
                  most works are limited in the sense that they assume equidistant rectilinear
                  (Cartesian) data acquisition in 2D or 3D. In practice, a reconstruction from
                  nonuniform samplings such as radial and spiral is an attractive choice for
                  more efficient acquisitions. Nevertheless, it has less been explored as the
                  reconstructi on process is complicated by the necessity to handle non-Cartesian
                  samples. In this work, we present a novel approach for reconstructing from
                  nonuniform undersampled MR data. The proposed approach, termed nonuniform
                  variational network (NVN), is a convolutional neural network architecture
                  based on the unrolling of a traditional iterative nonlinear reconstruction,
                  where the knowledge of the nonuniform forward and adjoint sampling operators
                  are efficiently incorporated. Our extensive evaluation shows that the proposed
                  method outperforms existing state-of-the-art deep learning methods, hence
                  offering a method that is widely applicable to different imaging protocols
                  for both research and clinical deployments.}

It has been shown that choosing the length of the piecewise segments adaptively based on data samples leads to improved accuracy of the subsequent processing such as classification. Traditional approaches are often tied to a particular classification model which results in local greedy optimization of a criterion function. This paper proposes a technique for learning the discretization parameters along with the parameters of a decision function in a convex optimization of the true objective. The general formulation is applicable to a wide range of learning problems. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed convex algorithms yield models with fewer number of parameters with comparable or better accuracy than the existing methods.},

This represents a challenge to the network security industry as the amount and variability of incidents has been increasing. Consequently, this complicates the design of learning-based detection systems relying on features extracted from network data. The problem is caused by different joint distribution of observation (features) and labels in the training and testing data sets. This paper proposes a classification system designed to detect both known as well as previously unseen security threats. The classifiers use statistical feature representation computed from the network traffic and learn to recognize malicious behavior. The representation is designed and optimized to be invariant to the most common changes of malware behaviors. This is achieved in part by a feature histogram constructed for each group of HTTP flows (proxy log records) of a user visiting a particular hostname and in part by a feature self-similarity matrix computed for each group. The parameters of the representation (histogram bins) are optimized and learned based on the training samples along with the classifiers. The proposed classification system was deployed on large corporate networks, where it detected 2,090 new and unseen variants of malware samples with 90\% precision (9 of 10 alerts were malicious), which is a considerable improvement when compared to the current flow-based approaches or existing signature-based web security devices.}

However, this assumption is violated in many real world problems, such as training a detector of malicious network traffic that can change over time as a result of attacker's detection evasion efforts. We propose to address this problem by creating an optimized representation, which significantly increases the robustness of detectors or classifiers trained under this distributional shift. The representation is created from bags of samples (e.g. network traffic logs) and is designed to be invariant under shifting and scaling of the feature values extracted from the logs and under permutation and size changes of the bags. The invariance is achieved by combining feature histograms with feature self-similarity matrices computed for each bag and significantly reduces the difference between the training and testing data. The parameters of the representation, such as histogram bin boundaries, are learned jointly with the classifier. We show that the representation is effective for training a detector of malicious traffic, achieving 90\% precision and 67\% recall on samples of previously unseen malware variants.}

identify malicious communication exploiting encrypted URL strings and domains generated by a Domain Generation Algorithm

can be built given only a limited amount of information extracted from a single proxy log. This way, the computational requirements
of the detectors are kept low which allows for deployment on a wide range of security devices and without depending on traffic
context such as DNS logs, Whois records, webpage content, etc. Results on several weeks of live traffic from 100+ companies
having 350k+ hosts show correct detection with a precision exceeding 95% of malicious flows, 95% of malicious URLs and

The goal of the object localization is to accurately find the object pose parameters relative to an established reference, such as the origin of the image coordinate system. The object classification assigns class labels to the objects according to the pre-specified categories. Multi-object recognition has been previously solved by designing a set of individual single-object detectors or by training a combined multi-object detection and classification system. In the medical domain, these models can be further improved by relying on strong spatial prior information present in medical images of a human body. This chapter describes, how the spatial prior can be used to recognize multiple anatomical structures which results in the Integrated Detection Network. The structures are recognized sequentially, one-by-one, using optimal order such that the later recognitions can benefit from constraints provided by previously recognized structures. The recognition relies on Sequential Estimation techniques, with the posterior distribution of the structure pose and label being approximated at each step by sequential Monte Carlo. The samples are propagated within the sequence across multiple structures and hierarchical levels. The system is general and provides accurate recognitions of anatomical structures in 3D images of various modalities.}

                  limited bandwidth between a (thin) client, Data Center (DC), and Data
                  Analysis (DA) server is addressed by a hierarchical detection algorithm

                  specific landmark. The algorithm obtains a coarse level image from DC
                  and outputs landmark location candidates. The coarse landmark location
                  candidates are then used to obtain image neighborhood regions at a finer

	abstract={Motivated by the goals of automatically extracting
		vessel segments and constructing retinal vascular trees with
		anatomical realism, this paper presents and analyses an
		algorithm that combines vessel segmentation and grouping of
		the extracted vessel segments. The proposed method aims to
		restore the topology of the vascular trees with anatomical
		realism for clinical studies and diagnosis of retinal
		vascular diseases, which manifest abnormalities in either
		venous and/or arterial vascular systems. Vessel segments are
		grouped using extended Kalman filter which takes into account
		continuities in curvature, width, and intensity changes at
		the bifurcation or crossover point. At a junction, the
		proposed method applies the minimum-cost matching algorithm
		to resolve the conflict in grouping due to error in tracing.
		The system was trained with 20 images from the DRIVE dataset,
		and tested using the remaining 20 images. The dataset
		contained a mixture of normal and pathological images. In
		addition, six pathological fluorescein angiogram sequences
		were also included in this study. The results were compared
		against the groundtruth images provided by a physician,
		achieving average success rates of 88.79% and 90.09%,
		respectively.},

  abstract =	 {Routine ultrasound exam in the second and third
	       trimesters of pregnancy involves manually measuring fetal head
	       and brain structures in 2D scans. The procedure requires a
	       sonographer to find the standardized visualization planes with
	       a probe and manually place measurement calipers on the
	       structures of interest. The process is tedious, time consuming,
	       and introduces user variability into the measurements. This
	       paper proposes an Automatic Fetal Head and Brain (AFHB) system
	       for automatically measuring anatomical structures from 3D
	       ultrasound volumes. The system searches the 3D volume in a
	       hierarchy of resolutions and by focusing on regions that are
	       likely to be the measured anatomy. The output is a standardized
	       visualization of the plane with correct orientation and
	       centering as well as the biometric measurement of the anatomy.
	       The system is based on a novel framework for detecting multiple
	       structures in 3D volumes. Since a joint model is difficult to
	       obtain in most practical situations, the structures are
	       detected in a sequence, one-byone. The detection relies on
	       Sequential Estimation techniques, frequently applied to visual
	       tracking. The interdependence of structure poses and strong
	       prior information embedded in our domain yields faster and more
	       accurate results than detecting the objects individually. The
	       posterior distribution of the structure pose is approximated at
	       each step by sequential Monte Carlo. The samples are propagated
	       within the sequence across multiple structures and hierarchical
	       levels. The probabilistic model helps solve many challenges
	       present in the ultrasound images of the fetus such as speckle
	       noise, signal drop-out, shadows caused by bones, and appearance
	       variations caused by the differences in the fetus gestational
	       age. This is possible by discriminative learning on an
	       extensive database of scans comprising more than two thousand
	       volumes and more than thirteen thousand annotations. The
	       average difference between ground truth and automatic measu-
	       ements is below 2 mm with a running time of 6.9 seconds (GPU)
	       or 14.7 seconds (CPU). The accuracy of the AFHB system is
	       within inter-user variability and the running time is fast,
	       which meets the requirements for clinical use.},

                  the comparison of nodules between CT scans from
                  subsequent visits by a patient is necessary for
                  timely classification of pulmonary nodules into
                  benign and malignant and for analyzing nodule growth
                  and response to therapy. The algorithm described in
                  this paper takes (a) two temporally-separated CT
                  scans, I1 and I2, and (b) a series of nodule
                  locations in I1, and for each location it produces
                  an affine transformation that maps the locations and
                  their immediate neighborhoods from I1 to I2. It does
                  this without deformable registration and without
                  initialization by global affine
                  registration. Requiring the nodule locations to be
                  specified in only one volume provides the clinician
                  more flexibility in investigating the condition of
                  the lung. The algorithm uses a combination of
                  feature extraction, indexing, refinement, and
                  decision processes. Together, these processes
                  essentially ``recognize'' the neighborhoods. We show
                  on lung CT scans that our technique works at near
                  interactive speed and that the median alignment
                  error of 134 nodules is 1.70 mm compared to the
                  error 2.14 mm of the Diffeomorphic Demons algorithm,
                  and to the error 3.57 mm of the global nodule
                  registration with local refinement. We demonstrate
                  on the alignment of 250 nodules, that the algorithm
                  is robust to changes caused by cancer progression
                  and differences in breathing states, scanning
                  procedures, and patient positioning. Our algorithm
                  may be used both for diagnosis and treatment
                  monitoring of lung cancer. Because of the generic
                  design of the algorithm, it might also be used in
                  other applications that require fast and accurate

                  detecting the ob- jects individually. Our approach
                  is based on Sequential Estimation techniques,
                  frequently applied to visual tracking. Unlike in
                  tracking, where the sequential order is naturally
                  determined by the time sequence, the order of
                  detection of multiple objects must be selected,

                  uncertainty in point correspondences. This
                  uncertainty is derived from the covariance matrices
                  of the individual point locations and from the
                  covariance matrix of the estimated transformation
                  parameters. Based on this uncertainty, CDC uses a
                  robust objective function and an EM-like algorithm
                  to simultaneously estimate the transformation
                  parameters, their covariance matrix, and the likely

                  low-contrast and narrow vessels and eliminating
                  false detections at non-vascular structures, a new
                  technique is presented for extracting vessels in
                  retinal images. The core of the technique is a new
                  likelihood ratio test that combines matched-filter
                  responses, confidence measures and vessel boundary
                  measures. Matched filter responses are derived in
                  scale-space to extract vessels of widely varying
                  widths. A vessel confidence measure is defined as a
                  projection of a vector formed from a normalized
                  pixel neighborhood onto a normalized ideal vessel
                  profile. Vessel boundary measures and associated
                  confidences are computed at potential vessel
                  boundaries. Combined, these responses form a
                  6-dimensional measurement vector at each pixel. A
                  training technique is used to develop a mapping of
                  this vector to a likelihood ratio that measures the
                  ``vesselness'' at each pixel. Results comparing this
                  vesselness measure to matched filters alone and to
                  measures based on the Hessian of intensities show
                  substantial improvements both qualitatively and
                  quantitatively. The Hessian can be used in place of
                  the matched filter to obtain similar but
                  less-substantial improvements or to steer the
                  matched filter by preselecting kernel
                  orientations. Finally, the new vesselness likelihood
                  ratio is embedded into a vessel tracing framework,
                  resulting in an efficient and effective vessel
                  centerline extraction algorithm.},

                  (Retinal Image Vessel Extraction and Registration
                  System), which provides the community of retinal
                  clinicians, researchers, and study directors an
                  integrated suite of advanced digital retinal image
                  analysis tools over the Internet. The capabilities
                  include vasculature tracing and morphometry, joint
                  (simultaneous) montaging of multiple retinal fields,
                  cross-modality registration (color/red-free fundus
                  photographs, and fluorescein angiograms), and
                  generation of flicker animations for visualization
                  of changes from longitudinal image sequences. Each
                  capability has been carefully-validated in our
                  previous research work.\\ The integrated
                  internet-based system can enable significant
                  advances in retina-related clinical diagnosis,
                  visualization of the complete fundus at full
                  resolution from multiple low-angle views, analysis
                  of longitudinal changes, research on the retinal

                  illumination differences (e.g.\ day and night),
                  substantial scene changes, and different
                  modalities. Our approach is a combination of
                  algorithms for initialization, estimation and
                  refinement, and decision-making. It starts by
                  extracting and matching keypoints. Rank-ordered
                  matches are tested individually in succession. Each
                  is used to generate a similarity transformation
                  estimate in a small region of each image surrounding
                  the matched keypoints. A generalization of the
                  recently developed Dual-Bootstrap algorithm is then

                  all driven by a new multiscale feature extraction
                  technique. After convergence of the Dual-Bootstrap,
                  the transformation is accepted if it passes a
                  correctness test that combines measures of accuracy,
                  stability and non-randomness; otherwise the process
                  starts over with the next keypoint
                  match. Experimental results on a suite of

                  algorithm capable of aligning images taken of a wide
                  variety of natural and man-made scenes as well as
                  many medical images. The algorithm should handle low
                  overlap, substantial orientation and scale
                  differences, large illumination variations, and
                  physical changes in the scene. An important
                  component of this is the ability to automatically
                  reject pairs that have no overlap or have too many
                  differences to be aligned well. \\ We propose a
                  complete algorithm, including techniques for
                  initialization, for estimating transformation
                  parameters, and for automatically deciding if an
                  estimate is correct. Keypoints extracted and matched
                  between images are used to generate initial
                  similarity transform estimates, each accurate over a
                  small region. These initial estimates are
                  rank-ordered and tested individually in
                  succession. Each estimate is refined using the
                  Dual-Bootstrap ICP algorithm, driven by matching of
                  multiscale features. A three-part decision criteria,
                  combining measurements of alignment accuracy,
                  stability in the estimate, and consistency in the
                  constraints, determines whether the refined
                  transformation estimate is accepted as
                  correct. Experimental results on a data set of 22
                  challenging image pairs show that the algorithm
                  effectively aligns 19 of the 22 pairs and rejects
                  99.8\% of the misalignments that occur when all
                  possible pairs are tried. The algorithm
                  substantially out-performs algorithms based on
                  keypoint matching alone.}

    Background:
    In the concept of cloud-computing-based systems, various authorized users have secure access to patient records from a number of care delivery organizations from any location. This creates a growing need for remote visualization, advanced image processing, state-of-the-art image analysis, and computer aided diagnosis.
    Objectives:
    This paper proposes a system of algorithms for automatic detection of anatomical landmarks in 3D volumes in the cloud computing environment. The system addresses the inherent problem of limited bandwidth between a (thin) client, data center, and data analysis server.
    Methods:
    The problem of limited bandwidth is solved by a hierarchical sequential detection algorithm that obtains data by progressively transmitting only image regions required for processing. The client sends a request to detect a set of landmarks for region visualization or further analysis.
    The algorithm running on the data analysis server obtains a coarse level image from the data center and generates landmark location candidates. The candidates are then used to obtain image neighborhood regions at a finer resolution level for further detection.
    This way, the landmark locations are hierarchically and sequentially detected and refined.
    Results:
    Only image regions surrounding landmark location candidates need to be transmitted during detection. Furthermore, the image regions are \emph{lossy} compressed with JPEG 2000. Together, these properties amount to at least 30 times bandwidth reduction while achieving similar accuracy when compared to an algorithm using the original data.
    Conclusions:
    The hierarchical sequential algorithm with progressive data transmission considerably reduces bandwidth requirements in cloud-based detection systems.},
