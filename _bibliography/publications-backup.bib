  abstract =	 {We address the problem of learning a detector of malicious behavior in network
	traffic. The malicious behavior is detected based on the analysis of network
	proxy logs that capture malware communication between client and server
	computers. The conceptual problem in using the standard supervised learning
	methods is the lack of sufficiently representative training set containing
	examples of malicious and legitimate communication. Annotation of individual
	proxy logs is an expensive process involving security experts and does not
	scale with constantly evolving malware. However, weak supervision can be
	achieved on the level of properly defined bags of proxy logs by leveraging
	internet domain black lists, security reports, and sandboxing analysis. We
	demonstrate that an accurate detector can be obtained from the collected
	security intelligence data by using a Multiple Instance Learning algorithm

                  in the cloud computing environment, this paper proposes an automatic

                  limited bandwidth between a (thin) client, Data Center (DC), and Data
                  Analysis (DA) server is addressed by a hierarchical detection algorithm
                  that obtains data by progressively transmitting only image regions required
                  for processing. The client sends a request for a visualization of a
                  specific landmark. The algorithm obtains a coarse level image from DC
                  and outputs landmark location candidates. The coarse landmark location
                  candidates are then used to obtain image neighborhood regions at a finer
                  resolution level. The final location is computed as the robust mean of the
                  strongest candidates after refinement at the subsequent resolution levels.
                  The feedback about candidates detected at a coarser resolution makes it

                  a finer resolution rather then the entire images. Furthermore, the image
                  regions are lossy compressed with JPEG 2000. Together, these properties
                  amount to at least 50 times bandwidth reduction while achieving similar
                  accuracy when compared to an algorithm using the original data.},

  abstract =	 {Routine ultrasound exam in the second and third
	       trimesters of pregnancy involves manually measuring fetal head
	       and brain structures in 2D scans. The procedure requires a
	       sonographer to find the standardized visualization planes with
	       a probe and manually place measurement calipers on the
	       structures of interest. The process is tedious, time consuming,
	       and introduces user variability into the measurements. This
	       paper proposes an Automatic Fetal Head and Brain (AFHB) system
	       for automatically measuring anatomical structures from 3D
	       ultrasound volumes. The system searches the 3D volume in a
	       hierarchy of resolutions and by focusing on regions that are
	       likely to be the measured anatomy. The output is a standardized
	       visualization of the plane with correct orientation and
	       centering as well as the biometric measurement of the anatomy.
	       The system is based on a novel framework for detecting multiple
	       structures in 3D volumes. Since a joint model is difficult to
	       obtain in most practical situations, the structures are
	       detected in a sequence, one-byone. The detection relies on
	       Sequential Estimation techniques, frequently applied to visual
	       tracking. The interdependence of structure poses and strong
	       prior information embedded in our domain yields faster and more
	       accurate results than detecting the objects individually. The
	       posterior distribution of the structure pose is approximated at
	       each step by sequential Monte Carlo. The samples are propagated
	       within the sequence across multiple structures and hierarchical
	       levels. The probabilistic model helps solve many challenges
	       present in the ultrasound images of the fetus such as speckle
	       noise, signal drop-out, shadows caused by bones, and appearance
	       variations caused by the differences in the fetus gestational
	       age. This is possible by discriminative learning on an
	       extensive database of scans comprising more than two thousand
	       volumes and more than thirteen thousand annotations. The
	       average difference between ground truth and automatic measu-
	       ements is below 2 mm with a running time of 6.9 seconds (GPU)
	       or 14.7 seconds (CPU). The accuracy of the AFHB system is
	       within inter-user variability and the running time is fast,
	       which meets the requirements for clinical use.},

                  timely classification of pulmonary nodules into
                  benign and malignant and for analyzing nodule growth
                  and response to therapy. The algorithm described in
                  this paper takes (a) two temporally-separated CT
                  scans, I1 and I2, and (b) a series of nodule
                  locations in I1, and for each location it produces
                  an affine transformation that maps the locations and
                  their immediate neighborhoods from I1 to I2. It does
                  this without deformable registration and without
                  initialization by global affine
                  registration. Requiring the nodule locations to be
                  specified in only one volume provides the clinician
                  more flexibility in investigating the condition of
                  the lung. The algorithm uses a combination of
                  feature extraction, indexing, refinement, and
                  decision processes. Together, these processes
                  essentially ``recognize'' the neighborhoods. We show
                  on lung CT scans that our technique works at near
                  interactive speed and that the median alignment
                  error of 134 nodules is 1.70 mm compared to the
                  error 2.14 mm of the Diffeomorphic Demons algorithm,
                  and to the error 3.57 mm of the global nodule
                  registration with local refinement. We demonstrate
                  on the alignment of 250 nodules, that the algorithm
                  is robust to changes caused by cancer progression
                  and differences in breathing states, scanning
                  procedures, and patient positioning. Our algorithm
                  may be used both for diagnosis and treatment
                  monitoring of lung cancer. Because of the generic
                  design of the algorithm, it might also be used in

                  uncertainty in point correspondences. This
                  uncertainty is derived from the covariance matrices
                  of the individual point locations and from the
                  covariance matrix of the estimated transformation
                  parameters. Based on this uncertainty, CDC uses a
                  robust objective function and an EM-like algorithm
                  to simultaneously estimate the transformation
                  parameters, their covariance matrix, and the likely

                  low-contrast and narrow vessels and eliminating
                  false detections at non-vascular structures, a new
                  technique is presented for extracting vessels in
                  retinal images. The core of the technique is a new
                  likelihood ratio test that combines matched-filter
                  responses, confidence measures and vessel boundary
                  measures. Matched filter responses are derived in
                  scale-space to extract vessels of widely varying
                  widths. A vessel confidence measure is defined as a
                  projection of a vector formed from a normalized
                  pixel neighborhood onto a normalized ideal vessel
                  profile. Vessel boundary measures and associated
                  confidences are computed at potential vessel
                  boundaries. Combined, these responses form a
                  6-dimensional measurement vector at each pixel. A
                  training technique is used to develop a mapping of
                  this vector to a likelihood ratio that measures the
                  ``vesselness'' at each pixel. Results comparing this
                  vesselness measure to matched filters alone and to
                  measures based on the Hessian of intensities show
                  substantial improvements both qualitatively and
                  quantitatively. The Hessian can be used in place of
                  the matched filter to obtain similar but
                  less-substantial improvements or to steer the
                  matched filter by preselecting kernel
                  orientations. Finally, the new vesselness likelihood
                  ratio is embedded into a vessel tracing framework,
                  resulting in an efficient and effective vessel
                  centerline extraction algorithm.},

                  algorithms for initialization, estimation and

                  physical changes in the scene. An important
                  component of this is the ability to automatically
                  reject pairs that have no overlap or have too many
                  differences to be aligned well. \\ We propose a

                  rank-ordered and tested individually in

                  Dual-Bootstrap ICP algorithm, driven by matching of
                  multiscale features. A three-part decision criteria,
                  combining measurements of alignment accuracy,
                  stability in the estimate, and consistency in the
                  constraints, determines whether the refined
                  transformation estimate is accepted as
                  correct. Experimental results on a data set of 22
                  challenging image pairs show that the algorithm
                  effectively aligns 19 of the 22 pairs and rejects
                  99.8\% of the misalignments that occur when all
                  possible pairs are tried. The algorithm
                  substantially out-performs algorithms based on

    Background:
    In the concept of cloud-computing-based systems, various authorized users have secure access to patient records from a number of care delivery organizations from any location. This creates a growing need for remote visualization, advanced image processing, state-of-the-art image analysis, and computer aided diagnosis.
    Objectives:
    This paper proposes a system of algorithms for automatic detection of anatomical landmarks in 3D volumes in the cloud computing environment. The system addresses the inherent problem of limited bandwidth between a (thin) client, data center, and data analysis server.
    Methods:
    The problem of limited bandwidth is solved by a hierarchical sequential detection algorithm that obtains data by progressively transmitting only image regions required for processing. The client sends a request to detect a set of landmarks for region visualization or further analysis.
    The algorithm running on the data analysis server obtains a coarse level image from the data center and generates landmark location candidates. The candidates are then used to obtain image neighborhood regions at a finer resolution level for further detection.
    This way, the landmark locations are hierarchically and sequentially detected and refined.
    Results:
    Only image regions surrounding landmark location candidates need to be transmitted during detection. Furthermore, the image regions are \emph{lossy} compressed with JPEG 2000. Together, these properties amount to at least 30 times bandwidth reduction while achieving similar accuracy when compared to an algorithm using the original data.
    Conclusions:
    The hierarchical sequential algorithm with progressive data transmission considerably reduces bandwidth requirements in cloud-based detection systems.},
